## Abstract

With the ready availability of COVID-19 vaccinations, it is concerning that a suprising large portion of the U.S. population still refuses to recieve one. The goal of this report is to analyze the demographics of those who choose not to recieve the vaccine and possibly find the reasoning behind their decision in order dissuade any concerns of those who may be on the fence over recieveing the vaccine.

## 1. Introduction

It has been shown by several economic and health institutions that rates COVID-19 in the United States have been among the highest in the world. Estimates show that about 10 million people have been infected and over a quarter of a million have died by in the U.S. by the end of November 2020 [^1]. Fortunately, several pharmaceutical companies such as() have managed to create a vaccine by the end of 2020, with several million Americans being given the vaccine by early March. Interestingly, it appears that despite the ready availability of vaccines, a sizeable portion of the population have no intention of recieving either their second does or either dose at all. Voluntarily recieving the COVID-19 vaccine is integral to putting the pandemic to an end, so it is important to explore which demographics are hesitanto recieve their vaccine and explore their reasons for doing so. 

## 3. Using Images

![Figure 1](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-314/raw/main/project/images/chart.png)

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].
## 5. Datasets

Datasets can be huge and GitHub has limited space. Only very small datasets should be stored in GitHub.
However, if the data is publicly available you program must contain a download function instead that you customize.
Write it using pythons `request`. You will get point deductions if you check-in data sets that are large and do not use
the download function.

## 6. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 6. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 8. Acknowledgments

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.
## 9. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
the first square bracket.
