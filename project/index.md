## Abstract

With the ready availability of COVID-19 vaccinations, it is concerning that a suprising large portion of the U.S. population still refuses to recieve one. The goal of this report is to analyze the demographics of those who choose not to recieve the vaccine and possibly find the reasoning behind their decision in order dissuade any concerns of those who may be on the fence over recieveing the vaccine.

## 1. Introduction

It has been shown by several economic and health institutions that rates COVID-19 in the United States have been among the highest in the world. Estimates show that about 10 million people have been infected and over a quarter of a million have died in the U.S. by the end of November 2020 [^1]. Fortunately, several pharmaceutical companies such as() have managed to create a vaccine by the end of 2020, with several million Americans being given the vaccine by early March. Interestingly, it appears that despite the ready availability of vaccines, a sizeable portion of the population have no intention of receiving either their second does or either dose at all. Voluntarily receiving the COVID-19 vaccine is integral to putting the pandemic to an end, so it is important to explore which demographics are hesitant to receive their vaccine and explore their reasons for doing so. 


## 2. Data Sets

The larger data sets used for this project are located in a github folder called "Vaccine Rate Data Sets". Here, one will find data including a table of the results of a study involving hesitancy in a variety of demographics [^1], vaccine hesitancy rates for all U.S. counties [^2], and vaccination progress for all 50 states [^3]. The smaller data sets and available visualizations for the larger sets will be provided below. 

### 2.1 COVID-19 Vaccination Hesitancy in all 50 States by County
